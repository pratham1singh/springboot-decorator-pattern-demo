# â˜• Decorator Pattern - Coffee System (Spring Boot)

This project demonstrates the **Decorator Design Pattern** using a simple coffee system implemented in **Spring Boot**. It allows dynamic addition of addons like **Milk**, **Sugar**, **Cream**, and **Choco** to a base coffee.

---

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Implements Decorator pattern in a clean and understandable way.
- Exposes two REST endpoints:
    - `GET /coffee` - View available product and addons.
    - `POST /coffee` - Send desired addons and receive the final decorated coffee with price and description.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:pratham1singh/springboot-decorator-pattern-demo.git
cd springboot-decorator-pattern-demo
```

**2.Run the Spring Boot Application**

Make sure you have Java and Maven installed.
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

## ðŸ“š What Youâ€™ll Learn
- How to use the Decorator Design Pattern effectively.

- Dynamic object construction using decorators.

- Spring Boot setup for a RESTful API.

## ðŸ§  Inspiration
This was created to explain how you can structure real-world solutions (like adding toppings to coffee) using decorators without modifying the base class.
